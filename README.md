# Sudoku-solver
 -Solving 9 by 9 sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithmn
#Overview
 -The user will enter the values of the unsolved sudoku puzzle
 -Where the values are not present, 0 will be keyed in there place
 -The algorithmn will check if through the entered values
 -Where the values are 0, the algorithmn will attempt to solve by trying to find that satisfy each position and removing those that don't
 -The algorithmn is recursive and will repeat itself until a valid solution that satisfactory is found
#Backtracking Algorithmn(src:Geeks for geeks)
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
